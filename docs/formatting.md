# Example Formatting

<div class="alertbox warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Some examples for specific versions (like those designed for Twine 1.4.2) contain this warning.</div>

<div class="alertbox information"><strong>Note:</strong> Other examples contain additional important information.</div>

## Summary

Each example is divided into sections. They start with a summary of the example and a short description of what functionality is used and why. If specific macros or functions are mentioned, they should be *emphasized* and link to their appropriate documentation where possible.

For terms that may not be familiar to a more general audience, they can be added to the Glossary file and their definitions will be available as a tooltip over the term or phrase in the HTML version of the book.

## Live Example

The next section demonstrates the code running.

```html
<section>
<iframe src="storyformat_recipe_example.html" height=400 width=90%></iframe>

Download: <a href="storyformat_recipe_example.html" target="_blank">Live Example</a>
</section>
```

## Twee Code

Finally, in the last section, all code is shown in its Twee notation for reference and download.

```twee
Twee notation
Download: <a href="storyformat_recipe_twee.txt" target="_blank">Twee Code</a>
```
