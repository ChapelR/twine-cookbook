(set: $chestOpen to false)

:: inventory [header]
You are currently carrying: 
<!-- if the inventory contains nothing, show "nothing" -->\

(set: $inventory to it + (a: 'a sword'))\

You see a chest here in the hallway.  \
(unless: $chestOpen)[\
    Do you want to open it?

    {
    (link: 'Open the chest.')[

        (goto: 'chest')
