# Style Guide

The Twine Cookbook uses certain conventions to indicate text should be considered [macros](./terms/terms_macros.md), part of [JavaScript](./terms/terms_javascript.md), or values to be used with either.

## HTML and Macros

All HTML and macro names (such as those used in Chapbook, Harlowe, and SugarCube) are escaped. They will appear like this `<div>` for HTML and this `<<include>>` for macros. This is done for easily allowing users to copy and paste the text from the Cookbook into Twine 2.

## Variables and JavaScript Functions

All variables are highlighted with *emphasis*. If a story format provides or an example uses particular JavaScript functionality, it will appear with **strong emphasis**.

## Quotation Marks

In some cases, the value of a variable is shown in quotation marks. This is to help uses see which values are used and how they might be transformed or inform certain functionality.
