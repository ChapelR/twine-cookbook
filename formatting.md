# Example Formatting

<div class="alertbox warning"><strong>Note:</strong> Some examples for specific versions (like those designed for Twine 1.4.2) contain this warning.</div>

<div class="alertbox information"><strong>Note:</strong> Other examples contain additional important information.</div>

## Summary
Each example is divided into sections. They start with a summary of the example and a short description of what functionality is used and why. If specific macros or functions are mentioned, it is highly recommended to mention and even link to their appropriate documentation.

For terms that may not be familiar to a general audience, they can be added to the Glossary file and their definitions will be available as a tooltip over the term or phrase after being processed.
