:: StoryTitle
Limiting the range of a number in Harlowe

:: Start
Initialize the numeric variable to a value with the range you want.
eg. between ''1'' and ''10'' inclusive.
&#40;note: You don't need to clamp anything at this point.&#41;\

(set: $valueToClamp to 5)
''Current value'': $valueToClamp

Increase the number to a value that is ''within'' the desired range.
eg. Add 1 to the current value.\

(set: $valueToClamp to (min: $valueToClamp + 1, 10))
''New value'': $valueToClamp

Try to increase the number to a value that is ''outside'' the desired range.
eg. Add 100 to the current value.\

(set: $valueToClamp to (min: $valueToClamp + 100, 10))
''New value'': $valueToClamp

Decrease the number to a value that is ''within'' the desired range.
eg. Minus 5 from the current value.\

(set: $valueToClamp to (max: $valueToClamp - 5, 1))
''New value'': $valueToClamp

Try to decrease the number to a value that is ''outside'' the desired range.
eg. Minus 100 from the current value.\

(set: $valueToClamp to (max: $valueToClamp - 100, 1))
''New value'': $valueToClamp
