# Saving Stories

## Twine 2

### Online

Stories are saved in the [local storage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) of a web browser. This is isolated between a browser and its use of incognito or private windows. *Clearing sessions and cookies in a browser may also clear the storage of Twine 2.* Using a different browser also means accessing different local storage.

### Desktop

When used as a desktop application, Twine 2 stores its files under the current user's files. The current collection of Stories can be accessed through the View -> Show Story Library menu option.

## Twine 1

As a desktop application, it stores its files in either HTML or as [Twee source code](../terms/terms_twee.md) on the local computer. It can import and export both HTML and Twee source code (`.twee` or `.tw`).
