# How to Review Your Story

Ready to publish your story? Great\! Here's a few ways Twine helps you
put the finishing touches on your work.

**Proofreading your work** can be daunting since you'd normally need to
look at each passage individually in the editor. Instead, choose *View
Proofing Copy* from the story menu. This will create a plain text
document with all of the text of your story split into sections based on
passages. You can print this document as-is, save to a PDF with your
browser, or copy and paste it into a word processor.

**Checking for broken links** can be done in two ways. First, any
passages that do have broken links will be tinted red in the story map.
Secondly, choose *Story Statistics* from the story menu. If the number
of broken links is 0, then you're good.
