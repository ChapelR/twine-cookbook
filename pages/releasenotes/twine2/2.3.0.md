# Twine 2.3.0

See the [2.3.0 project](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/projects/1)
for details on the changes in this release.

## New features

- The desktop app now uses Electron instead of NW.js. This should
    resolve many crash issues, and also bring improved performance, as
    saving changes is now done on a separate processing thread than the
    main user interface.
- The files in the story directory are now published as full-fledged
    stories, where possible.
- Bahasa Malaysia and Russian have been added as locale choices.
- Harlowe has been updated to 3.0.1. Visit the [web
    site](https://twine2.neocities.org/) for details.
- SugarCube has been updated to 2.28.2. Visit the [web
    site](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/releases.php) for
    details.

## Bugs fixed

- Issues with passages being placed in strange places after being
    dragged while Snap to Grid is turned on have been fixed.
- If you have a test or play version of a story already open when you
    choose to test or play it again, the window or tab should update
    with the current version.
- The welcome screen now scrolls properly when the **Next** button is
    used.
