# Twine 2.0.4

## Editor

### Bugfixes

- The app no longer mistakenly reports an updated version is available
    immediately after updating.
- If an error occurs within the library used to save stories, a
    notification is now shown to the user. Previously, notifications
    were only shown when an error happened within the Twine app itself.

## Features

- The tooltip for the story menu now shows the most recent date/time
    the story was saved.
- The Story Statistics dialog is back, and now includes the
    [IFID](http://ifdb.tads.org/help-ifid) for a story.
- Added experimental native app builds, available for now
    [here](http://bitbucket.org/klembot/twinejs/downloads) only. These
    builds have not been thoroughly tested; please use at your own risk.
    These save your stories to your Documents folder, under Twine \>
    Stories.

## Built-In Story Formats

- Updated Snowman to version 1.0.1.
