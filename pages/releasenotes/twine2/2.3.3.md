2.3.3
See the 2.3.3 project project for details on the changes in this release.

Bugs fixed
Proofing stories, broken in 2.3.2, is working again.
In previous versions, pressing control- or command-Z immediately after opening a text editor (passage, JavaScript, or stylesheet) would cause all text to be erased. This behavior no longer occurs.
The German localization has been improved (thanks to Kai Brueckers).
Features added
Added a Catalan localization (thanks to Jordi Mallach).
Added a Norwegian localization (thanks to sinwes).
