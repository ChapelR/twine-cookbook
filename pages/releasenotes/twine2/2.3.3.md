# Twine 2.3.3

See the [2.3.3 project](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/projects/4)
project for details on the changes in this release.

## Bugs fixed

1. Proofing stories, broken in 2.3.2, is working again.
2. In previous versions, pressing control- or command-Z immediately
    after opening a text editor (passage, JavaScript, or stylesheet)
    would cause all text to be erased. This behavior no longer occurs.
3. The German localization has been improved (thanks to Kai Brueckers).

## Features added

1. Added a Catalan localization (thanks to Jordi Mallach).
2. Added a Norwegian localization (thanks to sinwes).
