# Twine 2.3.2

See the [2.3.2 project](https://github.com/klembot/twinejs/projects/3)
project for details on the changes in this release.

## Bugs fixed

1. Various issues related to playing and testing stories within Twine
    have been resolved. Twine now opens playable versions of stories in
    your default browser instead of inside Twine.
2. An error where the editor UI became unresponsive after adding a new
    passage has been fixed.
3. Story formats with additional build information in their version
    number (e.g. "1.0.0-beta1") are now correctly handled.
4. Extraneous story saving, occurring when a passage was clicked but
    otherwise not moved or edited, has been removed.
5. The link to report a bug has been corrected to point to GitHub
    instead of the previous repository.

## Features added

1. Twine supports dark mode in macOS at a basic level. The window frame
    will change to match the system appearance, but you must still use
    the toggle in the story list to change theme. This may happen
    automatically in a future release.
