# Sugarcane

This displays your story with white text on a black background. Players can only see one passage at a time, though they can, if you permit, use their browsers' back buttons to return to a previous passage.

Sugarcane has a sidebar menu that may contain these entries:

- *Bookmark:* This serves as a link directly to the current passage, and is automatically updated throughout the game. Players can save their game by copying the URL from this link. (If your StorySettings disallows the ability to undo, then this is unavailable to players, as bookmarking can obviously be used to undo moves.
- *Rewind:* If a Sugarcane passage has the tag “bookmark”, then each visit to this passage will create an entry in the Rewind menu as a 'checkpoint'. By using that menu, they can rewind the game to that particular state. For obvious reasons, this isn't particularly useful if your StorySettings allows the Bookmark menu to also be present.

This is simply a variant of Sugarcane with a different design that is more readable on mobile web browsers, especially phones.
