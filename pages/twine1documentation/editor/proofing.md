# Proofing Work

To create an output file that is readable in a Web browser, choose **Build Story** from the **Story** menu. This prompts to choose where to save the finished story; make sure to give the file a `.html` file extension. After saving, Twine will open it in a Web browser.

Once the story has been built, it cane be quickly rebuilt to reflect changes by choosing **Rebuild Story** from the **Story** menu. For ease of access, this menu item also appears in the **Passage** menu of passage editing windows.

> **Reminder:** Reload the output story in the Web browser once rebuilding it. **View Last Build** menu item will open the last build.

**Story Statistics** shows detail about the **Story**. This counts how many words, passages, and links the story contains. It also displays how many broken links there are.

A RTF version of a story suitable for proofreading can be created through choosing **Export Proofing Copy** from the **File** menu. This compiles all the passage text only into a single document that can be opened up in another program.
