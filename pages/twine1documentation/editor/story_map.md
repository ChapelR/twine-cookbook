# Story Map

When a story is open in Twine 1, it shows the *story map*. This is a series of boxes that can be arranged in different ways.

Passages are *connected* with a line is shown between them. Using either a passage link or the `<<display>>` macro creates this line.

## Zooming

Using the secondary menu, clicking on the Zoom In, Zoom Out, Zoom so all passages are visible, and Zoom to 100% to change the size of all passages.

## Story Menu

New passages can be added to the Story through the **Story** menu. Use **Story -> New -> Passage** to add a new passage.

Right-clicking and go to and selecting **New Passage Here** also creates a new passage.

## Arrangement

Passages can be moved into any arrangement. This does not affect the output!

Any passage can be clicked and dragged to a different place. Multiple passages can be selected through clicking and dragging a square selection to enclose multiple passages. Once selected, they can be arranged.
