# *rot13(string)*

!!! Warning
    You are reading documentation for Twine 1. This is maintained for archival purposes only.

When given a string, it performs the ROT13 transformation on it, which simultaneously encodes normal text and decodes ROT13 text. (This is not expected to be a widely used function, but is available anyway.)
