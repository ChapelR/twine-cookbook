# Story Formats

When you publish your story to an HTML file, you can choose between story formats. These story formats control both the basic appearance and behavior of your story, though you can customize both of these via individual changes you make to your story.

There are two main story formats to choose from: Sugarcane and Jonah.

## Adding Formats

People have shared several story formats to date, the most famous being SugarCube. These can easily be added to become accessible from inside Twine.

### On Windows

Locate the "targets" folder in Twine's installation folder.
Inside "targets", create a folder with a header.html file here.
For example, Program Files(x86)/Twine/targets/sugarcube/header.html
After making any changes inside the "targets" folder, Twine will need to be restarted to update the Story Format menu. Once you restart, from the menu choose Story and then Story Format and select the folder name you created (i.e. sugarcube)

### On MacOS

Locate Twine.app where you installed it, most likely the Applications folder.

Right-click/control-click on Twine.app and click "Show Package Contents".
Navigate to the "targets" folder (in Contents > Resources)
Inside "targets", create a folder with a header.html file here.
After making any changes inside the "targets" folder, Twine will need to be restarted to update the Story Format menu.

### On MacOS X

Locate Twine.app where you installed it, most likely the Applications folder.

Create a folder called "targets" in the same folder.

Inside "targets", create a folder with a header.html file here.
After making any changes inside the "targets" folder, Twine will need to be restarted to update the Story Format menu.
