# `<<choice>>`

`<<choice>>` creates a branching path in the story through creating a link to another passage. When clicked, the story will transition to the passage. However, if the story is transitioned backward or it returns to the same passage, the other choices will no longer be available.

```twee
<<choice "Test 1">>
<<choice "Test 2">>
<<choice "Test 3">>
```
