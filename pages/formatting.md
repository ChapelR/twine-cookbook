## Summary

Each example is divided into sections. They start with a summary of the example and a short description of what functionality is used and why. If specific macros or functions are mentioned, they should be *emphasized* and link to their appropriate documentation where possible.

For terms that may not be familiar to a more general audience, they can be added to the Glossary file and their definitions will be available as a tooltip over the term or phrase in the HTML version of the book.

## Example

Each example has a link to a compiled example that can be imported in Twine 2.

## Twee Code

Finally, in the last section, all code is shown in its Twee notation for reference and download.

```twee
