# Choosing Between Twine and Twee

There are two types of applications for creating stories. Both have almost identical capabilities; they differ only in the interface you use to create a story.

- **Twine** provides a visual interface,a map of the story and easily visualize connections between passages. It includes an integrated text editor for editing passages. Most people will want to use Twine.

- ***Twee Compilers*** are meant to be run from the command line, after writing specially-formatted text files with a text editor. Creating stories with *twee* can also be automated or included in other scripts much more easily than Twine can.
