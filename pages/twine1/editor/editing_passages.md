# Editing Passages

!!! Warning
    You are reading documentation for Twine 1. This is maintained for archival purposes only.

To edit a passage, double-click it on the story map or select it, then choose **Edit Passage** from the **Story** menu.

The editor window has three main fields: the title of the passage, any tags that it has, and the body text. As changes are made here, the story map will update itself automatically. Close the window to finish.

The editor window's **Passage** menu contains a list of passages currently being editing (the **Outgoing Links** submenu), other passages that link to this one (**Incoming Links**), and links from this passage that don't have matching passages (**Broken Links**). Selecting a passage title from these menus will open it if it already exists, or create a new passage with the appropriate title if it does not.

To concentrate just on a passage's text, choose **View Fullscreen** from the **Passage** menu. In the fullscreen view, press the Escape key to close the passage and return to the story map, or press F12 to switch back to the windowed view.

## Adding Links

A shortcut exists for adding links: Select the text to add the link and then drag and drop the link text into the story map. This adds square brackets around the text selected, creates a new passage for the link to go to, and opens it for editing.

If a passage contains a broken link -- that is, it has a link pointing outward that does not have a matching passage -- then an exclamation point emblem will appear on the passage on the story map, to warn there is a problem.

To remove a link, just delete the double brackets around the text.
