# What do I need to know?

Nothing!

You can make a game, interactive project, or experimental essay without knowing programming or anything other than how to navigate a program and publish HTML using Twine 2!

However, getting the most out of Twine 2 can often require some knowledge of HTML, CSS, or JavaScript. Many [story formats](../terms/terms_storyformats.md) also use markdown to style text.

### HTML? CSS? JavaScript?

This Cookbook has entries on [HTML](../terms/terms_html.md), [CSS](../terms/terms_css.md), and [JavaScript](../terms/terms_javascript.md) as they are used in connection with Twine 2.

### Markdown?

Some story formats use ways of marking up words and phrases to add some *emphasize* or otherwise **style text**. These often differ between story formats, and it is highly recommended to consult the individual documentation of the story format for more information and examples.
