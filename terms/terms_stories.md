# Stories

Anything made using Twine can be called by any name. They are no rules on naming conventions and everything from experimental games to more traditional novels can be created in Twine. Everything is welcome. In general, the Twine editor calls individual projects Stories.

Stories can be published to HTML and readable in a web browser without Twine. In their published form, Stories can also be imported into Twine for further editing.

## IFID

Every Story is unique. When created, each Story is each given a series of letters and numbers called an Interactive Fiction IDentifier ([IFID](http://ifdb.tads.org/help-ifid)).

The IFID given to a Story when created is always retained. This helps authors track their Story on different platforms, and if other authors have copied or tried to claim it as their own without their knowledge or consent.
