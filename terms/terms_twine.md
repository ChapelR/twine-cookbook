# What is Twine?

Twine is an open-source tool for telling interactive, nonlinear stories using hypertexts. Navigation works by moving along, with, and through links. In Twine, clicking (or, on mobile devices, tapping) links is the most common, default action. Changing old, refreshing the current, or even loading new content is all done through this seemingly simple action.

The difference between hypertext and a more linear story such as those often found in books and magazines is in this link navigation. The player is given some degree of agency in their movement. They can make decisions while progressing through it or even if to continue at all.

## What can you make with Twine?

Anything! Because Twine produces hypertexts that web browsers can read, the limitations on Twine are not in what can be developed with the tool, but in the web browsers that run it. Anything that can be done in a web browser can be done in Twine.
