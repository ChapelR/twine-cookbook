# Markdown / Markup

All built-in story formats use a form of markdown or markup.

## Markdown?

John Gruber and Aaron Swartz created [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) [in 2004](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) with the goal to create a way of adding some extra symbols to text to easily convert it into HTML. Since then, it has become very popular with sites like GitHub [supporting it](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for text input.

Snowman and Chapbook use a modified version of Markdown for styling text.

## Markup?

Harlowe and SugarCube use what is known as [markup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language). To change the presentation of text, extra symbols are added to create visual effects like *emphasis* and a **stronger emphasis**. Most wiki software and sites like [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wikitext) use markup to style text.

## What's the difference?

Markdown *is* markup. It is a way of changing the presentation of text through adding extra symbols that have special meaning when other programs read it and convert it into a different format like HTML. The only real difference is that Markdown has a name whereas "markup" is a category of all languages that perform the same actions.
