# Welcome to the Twine Cookbook

The *Twine Cookbook* is a collection of examples organized around common topic areas. For each, contributors have tried to provide examples covering each major built-in story format (Chapbook, Harlowe, SugarCube, and Snowman) where possible and appropriate. For some topics, examples are also provided in SugarCane for Twine 1.4.2.

Each example page includes a short description, a live version, and its Twee code. Both the live version and Twee code can be downloaded directly from each example page.

## Reading the Cookbook

Created using [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), the *Twine Cookbook* is best viewed [as a compiled webpage](https://twinery.org/cookbook/). In this format, the left sidebar provides access to the different topic areas as well as to a search bar for more quickly looking through the titles and text of the entries. New updates are published in the website format every few months or as necessary.

The *Twine CookBook* can also be read without the live versions on GitHub by starting with the [summary page](https://github.com/iftechfoundation/twine-cookbook/blob/master/Summary.md). Note, however, that example pages on GitHub are subject change as new changes are made and revisions submitted before and during editing cycles.
