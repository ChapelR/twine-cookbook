# Welcome to the Twine Cookbook!

## About

The Twine Cookbook is a collection of recipes written in the [GitBook format](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook). To read the book on GitHub, start with the [summary page](Summary.md). To compile it in book-form locally, download or otherwise clone the project and then review the instructions for using GitBook's [command-line tools](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook/blob/master/docs/setup.md).

## Contributing

* How (or if) you would like to be recognized for your contribution

If the recipe is for an older version of a story format, please include that information in your submission as well!

### Via Pull Request
